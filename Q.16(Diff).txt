Q.16) Mention the differences between the delete, drop and truncate commands

DELETE:
Delete is a DML(Data Manipulation Language) command. 
	It is used to delete one or more tuples of a table. 
	With the help of the Delete command, we can either delete all the rows at once 
	or can delete rows one by one. i.e., 
	we can use it as per the requirement or the condition using the Where clause. 
	It is slower than the Truncate command.

DROP:
	Drop is a (DDL)Data Definition Language command. 
	It is used to drop the whole table & its structure.

TRUNCATE:
	Truncate is a (DDL)Data Definition Language command. 
	It is used to delete all the rows of a table at once. 
	With the help of the Truncate command, we canâ€™t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used. 
	It is faster than delete command.
